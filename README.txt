to run the code properly you need to: (must be ran in a browser like chrome)
1) change the directory path for the variable 'state2' to state2's directory path in state1.html to where ever you have saved state2.
2) change the directory path for the variable 'state4' to state4's directory path in state2.html to where ever you have saved state4.
3) change the directory path for the variable 'state1' to state1's directory path in state4.html to where ever you have saved state1.
this is so that when the buttons are clicked, the webpage will go to the correct state.
